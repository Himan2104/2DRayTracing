# 2DRayTracing
2D Ray Tracing / Ray Casting Simulation.


Made using C++/SFML.


This System could use some optimizations. If you're new to this and don't have any idea 
how to play around just open the definitions file (defs.hpp) and change the values there.
Everything is explained in the comments next to the values. Play around, fork it and make
it your own. 

Also, if you are looking to contribute or discuss anything related to simulations,
videogames or programming in general do consider joining this [discord](https://discord.gg/5WwyetY).


Thank You for your time! :)
